    "text": "Well, I will try blogging. I should have done this years ago, as with many other things, but better late than never.\nI am trying to learn more ‘software-y’ aspects of the ML/DS world. This will help. This blog is built with quarto. Clever people like Hamel have built theirs using it. I am giving it a try as well. It worked (relatively) easily. I know enough markdown for this to be an easy starting path. The best lesson learnt so far - creating a website involves as much copying other great examples, as any other software activity. Need to learn more of the .css/.nojekyll elements. I will - in time. For now, this is good enough.\nI intend to write mostly short “today I learned” or (TIL) posts. I learned about TILs from Vincent Warmerdam, who in turn has mentioned hearing about the idea from Simon Willison. I find it quite convenient. It gets you in the habit of writing down your thoughts, but in smaller bits. Trains you for long form posts. Helps with building a library of ideas/learnings.\nI will also maintain an active Reading List. I currently have a repo on the topic, but an editable blog post seems more elegant."
