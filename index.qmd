## Bio

My current job is to continuously learn and know as much as possible about LLMs and AI, apply that knowledge to products and features, and consult and advise on all matters related to AI.

My skills are an intersection between Machine Learning, NLP (which people call AI nowadays) and Business administration. I am the core AI Architect of [Ask FT](https://professional.ft.com/ask-ft).

Comfortable with Python, SQL and R. Experience with Google Cloud, AWS, Docker, Cloudera, Power BI, MicroStrategy. 

Throughout my pre-ML career, I've done Data Science Consulting, Operations management, Process improvement, Key account management, Quality management, Coaching and Customer Support for living. I am in my wheelhouse building trust with customers and stakeholders, managing change and nurturing teams.

- *2018* – HP CS President *Leading the Way* Global Award  
- *2019* – HP *Amaze* Global Award for “amazing contributions in both business impact and culture”

Happily married, proud father and husband.

## Flagship Project – Ask FT (Financial Times) (2023 - )

[Ask FT](https://professional.ft.com/ask-ft) is a generative-AI assistant that answers subscriber questions by synthesising two decades of FT journalism. It started as a simple demo (using semantic search and Falcon 7B), and reached millions of FT's Professional subscribers.

- Designed a **query decomposition and rephrasing pipeline** that balances speed with retrieval accuracy, running parallel searches when needed, while infusing knowledge of recent events prior to the search
- Through extensive **prompt engineering**, aligned answers to FT's strict requirements, balancing safety with answer helpfulness
- Designed a **custom moderation layer** to fit the FT's requirements, balancing blocking rate with false positives rate
- Continuously monitored **system quality and user feedback**, planned future features and initiated incremental improvements 

<small>In addition to FT's coverage, featured in [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/23/24106296/ask-ft-generative-ai-chatbot-answers-tool), [Voicebot.ai](https://voicebot.ai/2024/03/25/financial-times-launches-generative-ai-chatbot-for-subscribers-powered-by-anthropics-claude-3-llm/), [banker.bg](https://banker.bg/2024/03/24/the-financial-times-%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B0-%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0-ask-ft/) and others.</small>
