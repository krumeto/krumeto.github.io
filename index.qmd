## Bio

My skills are an intersection between Business administration and Data Science. 
Comfortable with Python's SciPy stack (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, keras, statsmodels), SQL and R (tidyverse, tidymodels, Rstudio stack). Experience with AWS, Google Cloud, Docker, Cloudera, Power BI, MicroStrategy. 

I've done Data Science Consulting, Operations management, Process improvement, Key account management, Quality management, Coaching and Customer Support for living. Contractual business is what I know inside-out. I am in my wheelhouse building trust with customers and stakeholders, managing change and nurturing teams.

I am currently focused on practicing and deepening my Data Science knowledge with the goal to become an end-to-end Data Science/Machine Learning practitioner - from Business understanding to Deployment and Monitoring. 

2018 HP CS President Leading the Way Global Award winner for significant achievements in developing MPS operations.
2019 HP Amaze Global Award winner for "amazing contributions in both business impact and culture".

Happily married, proud father and husband.
